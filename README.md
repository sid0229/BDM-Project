#Citizen Care Pharmacy: Unlocking the Potential of Data-Driven Solutions for B2C Success
This project focuses on the operational and financial analysis of Citizen Care Pharmacy, a retail pharmacy located in Sadar, Uttar Pradesh. Using sales and expense data from December 2024 to February 2025, the project identifies revenue trends, category-wise performance, and cost patterns. Key insights were derived through descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques, including clustered column charts, pie charts, line marker charts, and bar charts.
The analysis highlights critical findings, such as the dominance of Allopathic and Ayurvedic products, seasonal demand variations, and the impact of fixed costs like rent on profitability. Recommendations include optimized inventory management, targeted marketing strategies, and cost-saving measures to enhance operational efficiency and sustain growth. This repository contains the analysis process, supporting data, and actionable insights developed during the project.
